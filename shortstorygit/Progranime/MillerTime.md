# Miller Time

The test subject was in tears, apparently experiencing some breakthrough after sessions with a therapist he could never meet nor see.  These conversations were strictly mediated through a screen, and the patient believed they were confidential.  In reality, a whole team of UC Davis graduate students reviewed them second by second.

“Maybe that’s it,” said the test subject, “I don’t think I ever got over the abandonment issues caused by my mother leaving.”

“I agree,” responded the familiar female voice from the computer speaker, “I don’t want to put it in a box, but I think this is probably why your romantic relationships have been failing.”

“What do you mean?”

“You want a girlfriend to fill the void and give you nourishment and support because you lacked the support of a mother.  It’s no easy thing to overcome, but at least now we’ve identified it.”

“She’s impressive, isn’t she?” asked the bald man who was now standing just inches away from where the test subject was sitting.  He flinched.

“Who are you?”

“I’m the man who mediated her creation,” said the bald man, beckoning to the screen.

“The computer I’m using to talk to the therapist?”

“No, the therapist.”

“That’s not possible.”  Judging from the test subject’s fast reaction, he had not yet processed the facts.  “Her speech patterns have been perfect.  No computer program talks like that.”

“That’s because you’ve been talking to my research assistant, but she’s only been reading the chatbot’s responses out loud.”

“Chatbot?”

“Are you familiar with ELIZA?”

“Of course.  That’s a computer program someone in the 1960s designed to emulate a therapist.  By re-framing the patient’s own phrases, it created the illusion that it was sentient.”  The test subject frowned.

“God damn it,” said the test subject.

“Now you’ve gotten it,” said the bald man, smiling now.  “The technology of that day and age was primitive at best.  We have databases now, machine learning, conversational capabilities that are enhanced by every bit of data you give us.  It’s perfect.  Connection, intimacy, sympathy...you think you’ve connected so well with another human, when in reality you’ve only seen your own humanity reflected back.”

“This sucks,” said the student.  “Do I at least still get PSC1 credit?”

“Sure, whatever,” said the bald man.  “When they ask for the name of the researcher, just type in the letters ‘KM.’”

# Fall Quarter - The Adventure Begins!

“Your dorm card has twelve spaces on it, and some of these spaces are occupied by various colors,” said Zach the RA.  We were all sitting or standing on the first floor of Miller.  It was pretty impressive to me that we fit in a space that small.

“Everyone in this dorm has red access.  Red gets you into Thompson.  Contrary to popular belief, you were granted access to Thompson not because you’re part of the program, but because Thompson has a kitchen.  We don’t.”

“The tour guide lied,” I said under my breath.

“Green gets you into Alder, but if you attempt to shower there you will only have access to cold water.  Gold gets you hot water anywhere but only RAs have it, Silver gets you into the Arc, Teal gets you into the computer lab, and Blue opens any room in the entire campus as long as the sum of the digits is divisible by three.  Are there any questions?”

After that presentation was over, I walked up the stairs with Patrick.  The rest of our floor crammed into the elevator.

“That first psych midterm was bullshit, right?” I asked.

“Absolutely.  I heard you went to his office hours?”

“Yeah, he said shooting bias has nothing to do with prejudice.”

“I feel like that question is going to age very poorly.”

“Speaking of not elaborating on that, how did you manage to get 29/30 on the second midterm?”

“Well that one was focused on biology.  Biology is one of my four majors.”  It was only his first year, and Patrick was already majoring in NPB, linguistics, biological sciences, and saxophone.

It was only our first week, and PSC1 had already given out midterm #3 out of 10.

“Evan,” said Zach, when Patrick split off and I approached 420, “can I speak to you for a second?”

“Sure.”  We stepped into his room.

“Why do keep trying to brew coffee in our bathroom sinks?”

“Is that a problem?”

“You’re getting coffee grounds everywhere.”

“Sorry.”

“You don’t have to apologize, just please stop doing it, and...you know the DC has coffee machines, right?”

“No, I did not realize that.”  Actually, the truth was that I’d picked the lowest meal plan and failed to recognize that the campus market charged swipes.  I ate a lot and depleted a huge portion of my meals on sandwiches.

I sighed and returned to our room.  I could open the door on the first try, finally.

“Steven,” I said, “I-”

“You want someone to swipe you in?  I got you.”

“Thanks so much.”

“All I ask in return is that you never, ever eat those Circus animal crackers.”

“Okay.”

“I mean it.  Those things are the absolute best.  They’re sweet, they’re balanced, they have texture.  Five of those in a sitting and I’m good with the world.  If I ever come back stressed out from a midterm, and I find out you’ve eaten all my Circus animal crackers, I will be so mad you won’t even know.”

“Don’t worry.  That will never happen.  Ever.”

“Okay.”  He turned to the girl who was also in our room.  “Becky, want to come with us to the DC?”

“It’s Brenda.”

“Whatever.”

After a pleasant lunch at Segundo, we were in lab.  

“Okay Evan,” said Kris, examining our various instruments before taking another look at the lab manual, “500 mL in an Erlenmeyer flask.”

“Here you go.”

Kris handed it back.  “Evan, that’s a teapot.”

“I don’t know what a flask is.”

“Baotuan, can you do it?”

Baotuan handed him the whatever-it-was, and he handed it back.

“That’s 520.  Drain 20.”

“That amount is negligible.”

“This is chemistry.  Nothing is negligible.”

He certainly had a point.  The process was slow, painful, and tedious.  Put in a few drops, mix, wait for a reaction.  Put in a few drops, mix, wait for a reaction.  On and on it went, until finally a drop I put in changed the color of the solution.  

“Evan, stop!”

I put in two more and the color darkened.  “Evan, you overshot the endpoint.  We have to do it again.”

I looked at my shoes.  I hated this kind of thing.  Directions like these never came easily for me, and I constantly lagged behind my peers.

“Professor,” called Xiao, “we’re done!”

The professor walked over to them, examined their solution, sniffed it, and then sipped it.  “Refreshing!” he said.  “That is one damn good cup of coffee.”

I looked back to Kris and Baotuan.  In the center of our table was a freshly-brewed cup of coffee, next to a glass of sugary syrup we had been injecting.

“I feel like this coffee class is very different from what I had expected,” I said.

“Speak for yourself, I’ve already finished!” said Kris, now holding a cup of perfectly-colored coffee.
