# American Psycho-Pass

KM's office was reminiscent of an aristocrat's in some long-forgotten time, which made the gun on his desk look strangely out of place.  The trigger and color scheme made it look like a real gun, but the large front made it look like some sort of non-functional cosplay paraphernalia.  Zach sat across from him, at least a head taller in spite of the fact that KM was clearly the older of the two.

"I understand what you're suggestion," said Zach, beckoning to the gun, "but what you're proposing would only work in theory."

"How so?"

Zach, being a non-native English speaker, struggled for a few seconds to find the right words.  "You're saying that by using AI to determine whether or not this gun can fire, we can undo bias.  Prevent racism and the death it results in."

"Right."

"Well here's the thing," said Zach, "say that the data set I train my algorithm on is based on which people the police have already shot."

"Okay."

"That data could very well be biased, already.  You're essentially just automating racism.  Unless you give me unbiased data, which is incredibly hard to do, I'll need a way to offset the values.  That can lead to other problems...it's a very difficult thing."

"A team in UC San Diego is working on this as well.  Don't you want to beat them?"

"Well..."

Zach looked at the gun again, afraid to touch it.  "This thing really works?" he asked.

"Absolutely."  He picked it up and pointed it at Zach's chest.  "Let's give it a try, shall we?"

"But you say the software hasn't yet been written," said Zach, as he looked directly at the barrel, "isn't it just a normal gun, then?"

KM kept it trained at his chest, regardless.  

# Preparation

"I knew I would never get to see my father again," I rehearsed, while crying on cue, "but before he went, I remember his last words to me.  'Evan, you must go to the United States so that you can build scalable, fully reactive web applications.  If you can promise me you can do this, and follow the rules of Material Design, I will die knowing that you delivered products that were both aesthetically pleasing and provided your customers with a competitive edge.'"

"That was perfect," said Mark, my mentor.  "Now what is your elevator pitch for Google?"

"The same thing, but I'll be sure to mention that Google owns Material Design."

"Don't say owns," said Mark, "Google tries really hard to pretend it doesn't own anything, even though in the tech world they're basically gods and we're like helpless insects."

"Didn't you say you interned at Microsoft?"

"Yup.  Ant.  Now give me your pitch for Lockheed Martin."

"Before my brother succumbed to the wounds he has sustained in Iraq, I remember his last words to me.  'Evan, you must serve this country by building scalable, fully reactive web applications.'  Unlike him, I wasn't some gifted special ops agent...nor could I ever be.  But I could serve this country another way."

We were in the dining comes.  Mark was giving me and Baotuan the rundown.  This career fair had 120 companies, 108 tech companies, 200 recruiters, and not a single one of them would give a shit about my StarCraft rank.
